# Next.js 15 Server Component Error: Deeply Nested Data Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential error in Next.js 15 server components when dealing with deeply nested data structures.  Improper error handling in data fetching can lead to unexpected 500 server errors.

## Problem

When fetching data from an API within a server component, and that data is deeply nested, an unexpected structure (e.g., `undefined` or `null` in a nested property) can cause the component to throw an error without clear debugging information, resulting in a 500 server error.

## Solution

Implement robust error handling within the data fetching function to gracefully handle potential issues and provide informative error messages, improving debugging experience.
